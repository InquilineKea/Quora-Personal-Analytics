How can I get a text file of all of a Quora user's followers?,http://www.quora.com/Hacks/How-can-I-get-a-text-file-of-all-of-a-Quora-users-followers,Stormy Shippy,http://www.quora.com/Stormy-Shippy,Human,4,4,10:52pm on Tuesday,3,33,0,0,14,8,0,24,0,1,"If you are using Google Chrome, install the Scraper extension (https://chrome.google.com/extens...). Once Scraper is installed:Navigate to the followers page of a user (e.g. http://www.quora.com/Stormy-Ship...).If
 a user has more than ~15 followers, be sure to click on the 'More' 
button on the bottom of the page until all followers of a user are 
listed.Once all followers are listed, right click on any of the follower's name URL and select 'Scrape similar'.Done—export to Google Docs and do as you want.Note: for users that have thousands of followers, you are going to want to automate the clicking of the 'More' button.For example, it would take more than 1300 clicks to get access to Robert Scoble's
 followers (I don't recommend doing it this way on someone like 
Scoble—it will probably choke your browser and who knows what it will do
 to Quora's server—just wait for a real API).There are probably far easier and much more elegant ways to accomplish the automation, but here is how I did it:Install Selenium IDE for Firefox (http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/).Install Flow Control extensions for Selenium IDE per directions here: http://51elliot.blogspot.com/200...Install Firebug (http://getfirebug.com/).In Firefox, open Selenium IDE from the 'Tools' menu.Click on the 'Source' tab inside Selenium and paste the following code:  1

Is there a real reason to pH balance women's deodorant differently from men's deodorant?,http://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-real-reason-to-pH-balance-womens-deodorant-differently-from-mens-deodorant,Stormy Shippy,http://www.quora.com/Stormy-Shippy,I sweat.,1,0,"Feb 23, 2011",1,17,2,15,2,1,0,0,0,1,"There
 is scientific literature to support the idea that skin surface pH is a 
large factor in the performance of antiperspirants; however, there 
doesn't appear to be definitive research on whether there is significant
 gender difference in skin pH.The best summary comes from ""Textbook of Aging Skin"" (http://books.google.com/books?id...The
 pH of skin has been measured at multiple different sites in men and 
women with varying results in regards to gender differences. 
Measurements taken from the volar forearm have revealed no difference 
between men and women [19], men with lower mean pH values than women 
[20, 43], and women with lower mean pH values than men [44]. Similarly, 
measurements from the axilla have produced results of no difference 
between the sexes [45] or women with lower baseline pH values than men 
[46]. Men were also found to have lower pH values at five different 
facial sites sampled as compared to women. These results highlight the 
significance that sampling dif- ferent locations can have, and also 
again emphasize the need for further elucidation regarding the existence
 and significance of sex differences (> Table 93.4).Interpreting
 the findings in the studies discussed leaves something to be desired in
 regards to the systematic approach used to study the inherent structure
 and pathophysiology of skin. The relatively small subject numbers that 
characterize many of the studies results in a lack of power to support 
their findings.19.

What is the movie production company Screen Gems?,http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-movie-production-company-Screen-Gems,Stormy Shippy,http://www.quora.com/Stormy-Shippy,Human,1,0,"Feb 23, 2011",0,23,0,8,0,4,0,0,0,1,"EUE/Screen
 Gems Ltd. is a multi-faceted media company based in New York City. 
EUE/Screen Gems Ltd. has a six-decade legacy of producing film, 
television and commercial projects.Screen 
Gems focuses on films that fall between the wide-release movies 
traditionally developed and distributed by Columbia Pictures and those 
released by Sony Pictures Classics.-http://www.sonypictures.com/corp...Screen Gems has three different studios: New York, North Carolina and Atlanta.Their
 studio in Wilmington, NC is the largest television and movie production
 facility outside of California, with the third biggest stage in the 
United States and one of the largest special effects water tanks in 
North America.IMDB lists nearly 5000 works as being produced and 350 works distributed by Screen Gems (http://www.imdb.com/company/co00...).Screen Gem's 'About Us':Founded
 in 1948 by the brothers Mike & Steve Elliot, Elliot Unger Elliot 
quickly became the most creative production house in New York. The 
collaboration was a great success and the two directors each brought 
unique filmic sensibilities to their commercials.In
 the early 1960's, the company was bought by Columbia pictures. With the
 sale, the company was renamed EUE/Sreen Gems. Led by George Cooney, the
 division grew to become the largest producer of TV spots in the 
Advertising business. To grow the business, George Cooney led the 
development of the Post Production side of the industry that eventually 
became EUE/Screen Gems Video Services. Moving from the West side of 
Manhattan to the East Side, EUE/Screen Gems diversified its business 
into becoming the largest indpendent studio for Soap Operas on the East 
Coast.In 1984, George Cooney purchased 
the company from Columbia Pictures owner the Coca-Cola Company. 
Retaining the brand name that became synonymous with television 
commercials and Studio facilities, the company has remained a leader in 
its numerous lines of business and has developed assets and investments 
in Indie Film Distribution and Production facilities.Since
 our inception during the early days of Television and Advertising, 
EUE/Screen Gems has been setting the pace for change and innovation in 
the production business.Our philosophy 
has always been rooted in one principle: diversification. One rule we 
have is to never become complacent in an ever-changing content universe.
 That is why in 2000, the company bought control of the independent 
producer and distributor First Look Studios. Having produced the Indie 
hit Waking Ned Deving and Julie Taymor's Titus, First Look also owned a 
library of over 300 films.To adapt to 
the fusion of technology and entertainment, EUE/Screen Gems stays 
current with the creation Breed Digital. Modern day technologies and the
 internet have directly influenced entertainment and media. EUE/Screen 
Gems' newest division welcomes these challenges that technology brings 
to the industry.-http://www.euescreengems.com/#/T...See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scr...",http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-movie-production-company-Screen-Gems/answer/Stormy-Shippy,Marc Bodnickhttp://www.quora.com/Marc-Bodnick,""

those ideas are also some of the same that make popular web applications

mass-education become a lot less fulfilling. One thing is for sure, 
you'll never again be able to sit through an hour long lecture with 300 
other students. You'll also wish you had something similar while growing

pieces are there and thousands of individuals around the world are 
already taking the learning process into their own hands. If they stick 
to the fundamentals they started with, in my mind they have the best 
chance of anyone I've come across to be disruptive.With all the 
money that gets thrown at improving education in this country, it's 
wonderful that an open source effort without funding may cause the most
